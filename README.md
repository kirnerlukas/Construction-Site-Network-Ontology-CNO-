# Construction Site Network Ontology (CNO)


## Overview 
The Construction Site Network Ontology (CNO) is a domain ontology to describe concepts concerning wireless RF networks for construction sites. Its goal is to add concepts and connect them to existing ontologies such as ifcOWL to enable singal strength estimation approaches.
The Ontology is available at [http://w3id.org/cno#](http://w3id.org/cno#).
