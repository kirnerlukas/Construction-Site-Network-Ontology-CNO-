<p>To create this ontology, we followed the methodology described in "Ontology Development 101: A Guide to Creating Your First Ontology" by Natalya F. Noy and Deborah L. McGuinness <a
	href="https://protege.stanford.edu/publications/ontology_development/ontology101.pdf" data-reference-type="autoref"
	data-reference="NoyandDeborahL">[1]</a>. According to this guide, the first step
of ontology development is to clarify the focus of the ontology. For
this purpose, three questions are defined, which will be answered in the
following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Which domain should be covered by the
ontology?</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p>The ontology covers radio network modelling and signal strength predictions for construction sites.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>For what purpose should the ontology be
used?</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p>The ontology should enable the calculation of the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) calculation to predict radio networks’ relative signal strength at any spot on a construction site.
Therefore, it is necessary to be able to save and link data relevant to radio propagation of the frequency used connected with the building information modelling and construction process data.
It should enable the simulation of wireless communication networks with respect to changing spatial conditions of the construction site and propose possible adaptations to the nomadic network infrastructure</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>For what kind of questions should ontology be able to
provide answers?</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p>The ontology should be able to answer questions about the topology-related setup of the wireless network infrastructure and its current configuration.
It should help assign and query values for building materials describing their type permittivity and conductivity to query and calculate propagation losses dynamically and independently of the deployed radio frequency.

<p>
Competency questions are technical-functional in nature and describe
what queries should be able to answer precisly once the ontology has
been created. Therefore, they serve as the primary ontology development
procedure as they can be evaluated unambiguously. <a href="#tab:06"
data-reference-type="autoref" data-reference="tab:06">Table 2</a> lists
the most relevant competency questions used in the development
process.

The formulated competency questions are used as a basis to work out
which areas of the ontology need to be covered by concepts and
relations, and which functionalities need to be enabled by the ontology.

<p>The central concepts of the CNO Ontology are <strong>cno:Antenna, cno:Obstacle and cno:Material</strong>.
