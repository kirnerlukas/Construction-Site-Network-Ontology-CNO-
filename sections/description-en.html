<p>To create this ontology, we followed the methodology described in "Ontology Development 101: A Guide to Creating Your First Ontology" by Natalya F. Noy and Deborah L. McGuinness <a
	href="https://protege.stanford.edu/publications/ontology_development/ontology101.pdf" data-reference-type="autoref"
	data-reference="NoyandDeborahL">[1]</a>. According to this guide, the first step
of ontology development is to clarify the focus of the ontology. For
this purpose, three questions are defined, which will be answered in the
following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Which domain should be covered by the
ontology?</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p>The IoC Process Ontology should be able to cover the value chains of
the construction industry as comprehensively as possible. This includes
not only the design and construction phases, but also processes in all
phases of a structureâ€™s lifecycle.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>For what purpose should the ontology be
used?</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p>The goal of the IoC Process Ontology is the valid description of
processes in the construction industry. This includes all types of
construction processes such as execution, planning, production,
logistics, and assembly processes. To achieve this, it is essential to
interrelate the processes and contextualize them with time and location
information. The IoC Construction Process Ontology serves as a top-level
ontology and enables the linking of more specific and detailed domain
ontologies. The modeled and mappable processes aim to digitalize and
optimize the construction industry information flow and encourage the
use of innovative AI and construction robotics solutions.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>For what kind of questions should ontology be able to
provide answers?</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p>The IoC Process Ontology should be able to answer questions about the
nature of a process, its dependencies and its status. This should enable
simple interrelationships to be queried for roughly modeled processes,
and complex and detailed answers to be provided for use in process
control after further data input and with the inclusion of process data
feedback.

<h3 id="competencyQuestions" class="list">Competency questions <span class="backlink"> back to <a href="#toc">ToC</a></span></h3>
<p>
Competency questions are technical-functional in nature and describe
what queries should be able to answer precisly once the ontology has
been created. Therefore, they serve as the primary ontology development
procedure as they can be evaluated unambiguously. <a href="#tab:06"
data-reference-type="autoref" data-reference="tab:06">Table 2</a> lists
the most relevant competency questions used in the development
process.

The formulated competency questions are used as a basis to work out
which areas of the ontology need to be covered by concepts and
relations, and which functionalities need to be enabled by the ontology.
The areas mentioned in <a href="#tab:06" data-reference-type="autoref"
data-reference="tab:06">Table 2</a> indicate roughly the necessary
concepts of the ontology. Competency questions can also be used as a basis for evaluation. Within the
scope of the Internet of Construction research project, the evaluation of the IoC Process Ontology was of
great importance. Therefore, the ontology was extensively tested and
further developed on the basis of practical implementations at the
reference construction site of the RWTH Aachen University.

<p>The center of the IoC Process Ontology is the generic concept of the
<strong>process</strong>. The process is followed by the higher-level
concepts of the generic process modeling. The concepts correspond to the
domains that were developed using the competency Questions.
They are <em>process actor, process element, process
information, process method, process resource, process space,</em> and
<em>process status</em>. Concepts that can undergo a transformation by
executing the process distinguish by relations (object property) between
input and output concepts. An overview is depicted in <a
href="#fig:Abbildung03_11_2" data-reference-type="autoref"
data-reference="fig:Abbildung03_11_2">Figure 1</a>.</p>

<p>The generic concepts of the IoC Process Ontology (ioc) do not contain
    any taxonomic process classification. This is in order to achieve
    independence from individual construction-related domains as well as
    from international and national regulations and guidelines. All
    concepts, regardless of the level of detail, can be provided with
    metadata using concepts from PROV-O and SCHEMA, which are dynamically
    used for versioning and evaluation. The main concepts and their
    sub-concepts are described below.</p>

    <p><a href="#code:32" data-reference-type="autoref"
    data-reference="#code:32">Listing 1</a> shows an excerpt from a
    process model that was modeled and used within the IoC. Lines 1-4 define
    the used prefixes of the connected ontologies, which can then be
    abbreviated in the further lines. The actual process is defined in lines
    6-14. It is instantiated in line 6 with the IRI ioc:Process
    Stahlbinder-201. Usually the IRI is generated with the help of a GUID,
    so that uniqueness can be guaranteed. In the example given, this was not
    done for readability reasons. The process is classified by as
    <em>ioc:Process</em>. In this case <em>a</em> is used as short form of
    <em>rdf:type</em>. This can be used to answer competency question 2
    (CQ2) (see <a href="competencyQuestions"
    data-reference-type="autoref"
    data-reference="competencyQuestions">competency Questions</a>)
    about the class of the process. In the following, the abbreviations of
    the competence questions are given for further explanation of the
    example.</p>
    Line 7 shows the name of the process (CQ1). Lines 8-10 describe the
    subprocesses of the process, as well as predecessors and successors. It
    can be seen that the process has 3 direct predecessors. These are the
    creation processes for 2 reinforced concrete components as supports for
    the steel truss and the final assembly of the steel truss as the last
    modeled process of the subprocess chain. Lines 8-10 form the minimum
    substructure necessary for logical modeling of the process sequence.
    Line 11 describes the element that is created by the process (CQ3).
    In this case, it is a group of elements, since the steel truss consists
    of several subassemblies . The absence of a <em>hasInputElement</em>
    connection shows that in the present process a component is newly
    created and not just transformed or modified.
    Line 12 shows that a responsible person has been added to the process
    (CQ4). This connection makes it particularly easy to filter processes in
    order to display only processes relevant to the actor and possibly their
    predecessor processes.
    Line 13 contains the link to a process schedule (CQ6). Here, for
    example, a deadline can be defined as the end time, or, if the planning
    does not yet allow it, only an expected process duration can be
    defined.
    The status of the process is linked in line 14 (CQ10). In the first
    possible state of the process, the planned state, it must be possible to
    infer from the status that the process is neither ready to start,
    started, finishedor terminated. In case of status change, another
    process status with a current timestamp is appended. From the fact that
    the process shown in <a href="#code:32" data-reference-type="autoref"
      data-reference="#code:32">Listing 1</a> has only one process status,
    it can be concluded that it is the initial planned (as-Planned) process
    status. <a
    href="#fig:Abbildung03_21" data-reference-type="autoref"
    data-reference="fig:Abbildung03_21">Figure 2</a> shows an
    example of how different patterns can be formed to map a process
    status.</p>
    
    
    <div align="center">

              Concept.</figcaption>
        </figure>
    </div>
    
    <p>In this case, there are three statuses, each representing a different
    state. Patterns of booleans and timestamps can be used to record the
    progress. However, <strong>following Revision 0.4, this simplified method is deprecated and should be replaced as described in Section 3.5</strong>.
    In the example from <a href="#fig:Abbildung03_21"
    data-reference-type="autoref"
    data-reference="fig:Abbildung03_21">Figure 2</a>, it can be
    read that on 20.11.2022 at 10:00 AM, the prerequisites for the start of the
    process were met and it was thus marked as ready. From the other
    statuses, it can be concluded that the process was started 15 minutes
    later and lasted one hour until it was marked as completed (CQ7).</p>
    <p>Schedule and status, especially in combination, can provide important
    information that can be used, for example, for construction
    documentation and optimization. After a process has been completed, it
    can be recorded whether the planned end time was adhered to or whether
    the expected process duration applies. This derived information can be
    related to other process information to identify patterns. In this way,
    it can be analyzed whether processes that particularly often lead to
    deviation are part of certain process chains or are executed with
    certain machines.</p>

    <p>Compared to the parent process, it is noticeable here that the
    process contains an input and an output connection to the same instance
    of an element (lines 11-12). This logic describes in the data model that
    the element is required as a prerequisite for the process and remains
    unchanged. On the other hand, lines 13-14 indicate the original and the
    post-process resulting location of the process, which are different. In
    this case, the component was lifted from the storage area, a temporary
    foundation area of a TinyHouse to the final location of the component
    (CQ5). The data pattern of two different process locations can be
    interpreted as a logistics process where something was moved between two
    locations. The current location of a component was determined in IoC
    using process chaining. For example, a query can be used to determine
    the last process started that linked the component to a location. In the
    example, this can also be a process such as Storage, which is linked to
    a location and a status and can also provide easily retrievable
    information about where a component has been and for how long.
    Line 15 describes the method associated with the process (CQ8). This
    is primarily required for so-called capability matching which describes the matching of capability requirements imposed by a
    process with the capabilities provided by a resource. For example, a
    lifting process might have the capability lift associated with a range
    of values at tonnage values (e.g., lift: 0-3 tons). The method in this
    case would be lift. Methods are closely related to the description of
    resources. In line 17, the link to a resource is modeled (CQ9). In this case, it
    is the digital representation of a tower crane. Especially for
    resources, the linking of domain ontologies lends itself. For example, a
    version of the construction equipment list modeled with the help of an
    ontology would be conceivable. All this linked data can be used to model the processes and, after
    they have been executed, to present them in documentation (CQ12), which
    can be used for optimization, for example.</p>

    <h3 id="Dynamicapproaches" class="list">Dynamic process data approaches<span class="backlink"> back to <a href="#toc">ToC</a></span></h3>
    
    <p>In the original version of the IoC Process Ontology developed and
    thoroughly tested in the IoC research project, dynamic features were
    only intended to be used with the concepts <em>ioc:Schedule</em> and
    <em>ioc:Status</em>. This helped to keep the ontology simple, but also
    led to issues in querying and limitations in describing planning history
    and change management. For example, especially as the number of forks
    for status grows, SPARQL queries looking for the most recent value
    become increasingly slow.</p>
    <p>A solution to this problem in the adjacent field of modeling dynamic
    building property values was presented by Rassmussen et al. in the form
    of the OPM ontology <a
    href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/326930517_OPM_An_ontology_for_describing_properties_that_evolve_over_time" data-reference-type="autoref"
    data-reference="OPM">[2]</a>. In essence, the ontology
    introduces a class called <em>opm:CurrentPropertyState</em>, which is
    assigned only to the most recently defined instance of a property state.
    Queries that use this concept are much more efficient than queries that
    compare data timestamps and search for the most recent.</p>
    <p>This solution was adapted for the IoC Process Ontology with
    introducing the intermediate class <em>ioc:ProcessDataState</em> as well
    as a supcerclass for the existing concepts like <em>ioc:Actor,
    ioc:Method, ioc:Status</em> and so on. They are connected from
    <em>ioc:Process</em> with subproperties of
    <em>ioc:hasProcessDataState</em> and <em>ioc:hasValue</em>. A direct
    comparison between the original and the advanced approach can be drawn
    from <a href="#code:33" data-reference-type="autoref"
    data-reference="#code:33">Listing 3</a> and <a href="#code:34" data-reference-type="autoref"
    data-reference="#code:35">Listing 4</a>. Here the main change can be
    seen in <a href="#code:34" data-reference-type="autoref"
    data-reference="#code:35">Listing 4</a>, lines 10-12. The timestamp
    moved from the <em>ioc:Status</em> class to the datastate, as well as
    the current datastate is specified.

    <p>While the readability suffered, the approach offers three relevant
    advantages:</p>
    <ol>
    <li><p>The current state can be queried with the existence of the
    <em>CurrentProcessDataState</em> class, which is much fast to comparing
    timestamps against each others.</p></li>
    <li><p>Additional meta-information like the author of the information
    can be added to the construct. Beforehand, it was inambigious especially
    when confusing the author of the data with the actor fo the
    process.</p></li>
    <li><p>The restrictions modeled in the ontology persist or can be
    described more precise no matter the number of versions
    declared.</p></li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>To further explain the third advantage, the example of a process
    status is again used. Whereas a process can have many different linked
    status depending on its history, the enhanced dynamic approach offers to
    restrict the number of valid (current) values. A Restriction necessarily assigns maximum one current state. For this state, it can be further restricted that it always describes exactly one status. 
    This improved level of detail in restriction helps implementing more advanced reasoning approaches.

    <p>Another approach for enabling dynamic process data and addition of
    metadata is the implementation of <em>RDF-star</em> (RDF*). RDF* extends
    RDF to enable making statements about other statements and therefore
    adding metadata. RDF* improves readability greatly, and is actively developed further.
    However not all triple-stores support this standard, and in contrast to
    the enhanced, OPM-like technique shown presented here, there is no option known to the authors of
    formalizing the statements in the ontology itself.
